# Bengali Speech Synthesis

In this notebook Bengali Speech Synthesis examples are presented. [CoquiTTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) is used to build this speech synthesizer. For TTS [GlowTTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11129) is used. [HifiGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646) is used as Vocoder. Both of the model was trained for 50K Global Step. Further Training will improve speech quality.
